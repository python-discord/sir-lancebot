A Discord bot built by the Python Discord community, for the Python Discord community.

You can find our community by going to https://discord.gg/python

## Motivations

We know it can be difficult to get into the whole open source thing at first. To help out, we started the HacktoberBot community project during [Hacktoberfest 2018](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) to help introduce and encourage members to participate in contributing to open source, providing a calmer and helpful environment for those who want to be part of it.

This later evolved into a bot designed as a fun and beginner-friendly learning environment for writing bot features and learning open-source.
