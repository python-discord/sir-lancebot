        "fact": "The decapitated head of a dead snake can still bite, even hours after death. These types of bites usually contain huge amounts of venom."
    },
    {
        "fact": "What is considered the most 'dangerous' snake depends on both a specific country’s health care and the availability of antivenom following a bite. Based on these criteria, the most dangerous snake in the world is the saw-scaled viper, which bites and kills more people each year than any other snake."

    {
        "fact": "The fear of snakes (ophiophobia or herpetophobia) is one of the most common phobias worldwide. Approximately 1/3 of all adult humans areophidiophobic , which suggests that humans have an innate, evolutionary fear of snakes."

    {
        "fact": "The warmer a snake’s body, the more quickly it can digest its prey. Typically, it takes 3–5 days for a snake to digest its meal. For very large snakes, such as the anaconda, digestion can take weeks."

        "fact": "The most advanced snake species in the world is believed to be the black mamba. It has the most highly evolved venom delivery system of any snake on Earth. It can strike up to 12 times in a row, though just one bite is enough to kill a grown man.o"
    },
    {
        "fact": "The inland taipan is the world’s most toxic snake, meaning it has both the most toxic venom and it injects the most venom when it bites. Its venom sacs hold enough poison to kill up to 80 people."
    },
    {
        "fact": "The death adder has the fastest strike of any snake in the world. It can attack, inject venom, and go back to striking position in under 0.15 seconds."

        "fact": "Naturalist Paul Rosolie attempted to be the first person to survive being swallowed by an anaconda in 2014. Though he was wearing a specially designed carbon fiber suit equipped with a breathing system, cameras, and a communication system, he ultimately called off his stunt when he felt like the anaconda was breaking his arm as it tightened its grip around his body."

        "fact": "A snake’s fangs usually last about 6–10 weeks. When a fang wears out, a new one grows in its place."
    },
    {
        "fact": "Because the end of a snake’s tongue is forked, the two tips taste different amounts of chemicals. Essentially, a snake 'smells in stereo' and can even tell which direction a smell is coming from. It identifies scents on its tongue using pits in the roof of its mouth called the Jacobson’s organ."

    },
    {
        "fact": "The king cobra is thought to be one of the most intelligent of all snakes. Additionally, unlike most snakes, who do not care for their young, king cobras are careful parents who defend and protect their eggs from enemies."

    },
    {
        "fact": "Elephant trunk snakes are almost completely aquatic. They cannot slither because they lack the broad scales in the belly that help other snakes move on land. Rather, elephant trunk snakes have large knobby scales to hold onto slippery fish and constrict them underwater."

    {
        "fact": "The shortest known snake is the thread snake. It is about 4 inches long and lives on the island of Barbados in the Caribbean. It is said to be as 'thin as spaghetti' and it feeds primarily on termites and larvae."

It coiled around the man and carried him into a tree. The man wrapped his shirt over the snake’s mouth to prevent it from swallowing him, and he was finally rescued by police after calling for help on his cell phone."

        "fact": "The black mamba is the world’s fastest snake and the world’s second-longest venomous snake in the world, after the king cobra. Found in East Africa, it can reach speeds of up to 12 mph (19kph). It’s named not from the color of its scales, which is olive green, but from the inside of its mouth, which is inky black. Its venom is highly toxic, and without anti-venom, death in humans usually occurs within 7–15 hours."

    },
    {
        "fact": "Two-headed snakes are similar to conjoined twins: an embryo begins to split to create identical twins, but the process does not finish. Such snakes rarely survive in the wild because the two heads have duplicate senses, they fight over food, and one head may try to eat the other head."
    },
    {
        "fact": "Snakes can be grouped into two sections: primitive snakes and true (typical) snakes. Primitive snakes—such as blind snakes, worm snakes, and thread snakes—represent the earliest forms of snakes. True snakes, such as rat snakes and king snakes, are more evolved and more active."

    },
    {
        "fact": "Approximately 70% of snakes lay eggs. Those that lay eggs are called oviparous. The other 30% of snakes live in colder climates and give birth to live young because it is too cold for eggs outside the body to develop and hatch."
    },
    {
        "fact": "Most snakes have an elongated right lung, many have a smaller left lung, and a few even have a third lung. They do not have a sense of taste, and most of their organs are organized linearly."
